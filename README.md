# API-Challenge-6
## Deliverable 1:
I Created a folder called Weather_Database to save all the files related with this deliverable. Then I saved the Weather_Database_starter_code.ipynb starter code to the Weather_Database folder and rename it as Weather_Database.ipynb. I Used the np.random.uniform function to generate a new set of 2,000 random latitudes and 2,000 longitudes. I also Used the citipy module to get the nearest city for each latitude and longitude combination. After that, I mported OpenWeatherMap's API key and assembled the API call URL as a string variable. For confidiality, I added a file calld .gitignore to save my API key to avoid publishing my API key on your GitHub repository. Retrieve the Latitude and longitude, Maximum temperature, Percent humidity, Percent cloudiness, Wind speed, and Weather description. Last, I added the weather data to a new DataFrame.
